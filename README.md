## Climate Change on Earth During the Last 150 - 270 Years

Climate change works slowly but over centuries it can be quite visible. This graph demonstrates that no place on Earth can remain </br>
unaffected, although certain cities in Brazil and island regions such as Hawaii appear to have been particularly vulnerable.

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv

The discrete distribution shows how uncertainty in weather measurements has decreased over the years. Longer vertical lines in the earlier </br>
years denote occasionally long visit times to the weather station and the use of mercury therometers. In the 1940s, weather stations moved to airports, 
which also increases uncertainty for purposes of comparison.

The dataset has one daily average observation for the first of each month, so certain extreme weather events may be missing. The intent of the graph
is to show long-term trends, not short-term events.

The orange line is the average monthly reading for the first 50 years of record-keeping for the given city. 

When looking at the thick blue band in the middle of each graph, bear in mind that this is a cluster of values tending toward the average </br>
monthly climate over a given year. High uncertainty and/or extreme weather events on the first of each month can on rare occasions make </br>
50-year average appear distorted, when in fact it is merely reflecting values outside the blue band.
